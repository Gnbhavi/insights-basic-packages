# insights-basic-packages
This repository tells the everyday useable commands of basic packages. Here, we are going to discuss about 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Before going into packages we need to create an environment to work on so that if something happens it only affects the environment not the base python installed in your computer. For environments we can use tools like
- Virtual env(pip)
- Conda
